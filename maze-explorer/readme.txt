Assumptions

1. I have made the assumption that the start point 'S' and exit 'F' are not empty spaces, but they are accessible.
2. A left/right turn is a 90 degree turn and a turn around is a 180 degree turn.
3. Movement options available to the explorer is expressed in terms of Cardinal Directions North,East,South, and West.
4. In determining what options are available I have made the assumption that the explorer can go forwards and backwards
through the maze regardless of whether it's explored that cell before or not.
